This contains all the files used in the NASA Astronomy Virtual 
Observatories resources site.  The main page is index.html.  
This page assumes being able to use virtual includes.  The file 
"includes/footer.html"  needs to be edited to put in the 
"Responsible Official", the "Web Curator", and the email address 
for the "Contact Us" link.
