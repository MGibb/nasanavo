This contains all the files used in the NASA Astronomy Virtual 
Observatories resources site.  The main page is resources.html.  
This page assumes being able to use virtual includes.  The file 
"includes/footer.html" has the contact info for the developers 
at the HEASARC, but each site should create a local copy and change 
the info under "Responsible Official", "Web Curator", and "Contact Us" 
to reflect the information for that site.
